# CS1115 Solutions

These are my solutions for CS 115 labs and homeworks.

## autograder

I have included a checker script to check homeworks, labs, and anyhting you are submitting. It checks for your name, pledge, and it checks to see if docstrings exist in your functions. It will also run the test script if there are test scripts provided in the function arguments. To understand how to use this, refer to the docstrings in the `autograder.py` file.
