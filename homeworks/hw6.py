#Q: explain what is the largest number of bits that your compress algorithm could possibly use to encode a 64-bit string/image.
#A: the largest number of bits we could use is 6 bits, if a image is 64 bits of only white or only black, then we would return a binary number of 100000 which is 6 bits.

#Q: argue to NASA that Professor Lai is Lai-ingâ€”such an algorithm cannot  exist! Try to make your reasoning as convincing and water-tight as possible. (In essence, you are proving that such an algorithm cannot exist.)
#A: The reason why an algorithm like this cannot work is because even if your compressed block size was a singular bit (which it cant be because you cannot represent multiple numbers in one bit) if there was a 64bit long string of repeating 01 or repeating 10
# it would give you a compression of the same length. This means her LaiCompress algorithm cannot compress every image into a small bit of data.
